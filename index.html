            <li class="info-list">Rafael Nadal is a Spanish professional tennis player. He is ranked world No. 4 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and has been ranked world No. 1 for 209 weeks, finishing as the year-end No. 1 five times.</li>

            <li class="info-list">He has won 91 ATP singles titles, with 62 of these on clay. Nadal's 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.</li>
            <li class="info-list">Nadal was one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching No. 2 in the world and winning 16 titles before his 20th birthday, including his first French Open and six Masters events.</li>
